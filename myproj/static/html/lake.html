        A lake is a naturally occurring, relatively large body of water localized in a basin surrounded by dry land.
        [1] A lake generally has a slower-moving flow than the inflow or outflow stream(s) that serve to feed or drain it.
        [2] Lakes lie completely on land and are separate from the ocean, although, like the much larger oceans, they form part of the Earth's water cycle by serving as large standing pools of storage water. 
        Most lakes are freshwater and account for almost all the world's surface freshwater, but some are salt lakes with salinities even higher than that of seawater.
