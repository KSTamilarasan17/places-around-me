        Atiyamāṉ (also known as Adhiyamān, Adigamān or Satyaputra-Atiyān) were a royal Velir dynasty. 
        These king-chiefs ruled from their capital Tagadur[3] (present day Dharmapuri) from at least the 3rd century BCE.
        The royal house was one of the four kingdoms of Tamilakam, ruling parts of the Kongu Nadu.
        They were surrounded by the Cheras to the west and the Pandyas and Cholas to the east.
